*Predicting the Beats-per-Minute of Songs (Kaggle Playground S5E9)*

This repository is a sandbox / working space for the Kaggle competition **Playground Series — Season 5, Episode 9**, whose goal is to predict the beats-per-minute (BPM) of songs. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Competition Overview

- **Name:** Predicting the Beats-per-Minute of Songs (Playground S5E9) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Task:** Regression — predict BPM (beats-per-minute) for each song  
- **Metric:** Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) — lower is better :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Data Provided:** Features extracted from songs (acoustic / signal features) and target BPM. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Goal:** Build models / pipelines that can generalize well and minimize RMSE on held-out data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+  
- Packages typically used in ML workflows:  
  - `numpy`, `pandas`  
  - `scikit-learn`  
  - `lightgbm`, `xgboost`, `catboost` (optional)  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` (for visualization)  
  - `joblib` or `pickle` (for model persistence)  
  - `notebook` / `jupyterlab`  

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Playground_prediction.git
   cd Playground_prediction
   ```
(Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On Linux / macOS
# or: venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
Install dependencies:
```
bash
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Future Work

-> Further feature engineering (domain-inspired features)

-> Neural network / deep learning architectures

-> Signal / audio processing methods (if raw audio available)

-> More advanced ensembling / stacking

-> Uncertainty estimation (predict confidence on BPM)

-> Automating pipeline (MLflow, Prefect, etc.)
